</p>

A working example of [Plaid Core Exchange](https://plaid.com/core-exchange/docs/) with OpenID Connect and FDX API v6.3. We built this with TypeScript, Express, and battle-tested OAuth libraries so you can see how all the pieces fit together.

## What's Inside

**The Core Stuff:**

- **TypeScript** (v5.9) with ESM modules everywhere
- **Node.js** (v22+) - Yes, you need the latest
- **pnpm** (v10) - For managing our monorepo workspace

**OAuth/OIDC (the important bits):**

- **oidc-provider** (v9) - Standards-compliant OpenID Provider
- **openid-client** (v6) - Certified Relying Party client
- **jose** (v6) - JWT validation and JWKS handling

**Infrastructure:**

- **Express** (v5) - Our HTTP server framework
- **Caddy** - Reverse proxy that handles HTTPS with zero config
- **Temporal** - Durable workflow engine for resilient operations
- **Pino** - Fast, structured JSON logging
- **Helmet** - Security headers on by default

**Frontend:**

- **EJS** - Server-side templates (keeping it simple)
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4) - Utility-first styling
- **tsx** - TypeScript execution with hot reload

**Development:**

- **concurrently** - Runs multiple services at once
- **ESLint** - Keeps our code consistent

## How It's Organized

This monorepo has three main apps and some shared utilities:

### Authorization Server (`apps/auth`)

The OpenID Provider. This is where users log in and grant permissions. We're using `oidc-provider` (embedded in Express) to handle the OAuth dance—authentication, authorization, and token issuance. It supports multiple clients, refresh tokens with configurable lifetimes, and resource indicators (RFC 8707) for JWT access tokens. Right now it uses in-memory storage, but we have our eye on a PostgreSQL adapter.

**What it does:** Login and consent UI (with EJS + Tailwind), configurable scopes and claims, forced interaction flows, RP-initiated logout

### Resource Server (`apps/api`)

The protected API implementing FDX v6.3 using Plaid's Core Exchange. Every request gets validated—we check JWT access tokens using `jose` against the Auth server's JWKS endpoint and enforce scope-based authorization. Customer and account data live here, accessed via a repository pattern.

**Built for resilience:** All data operations run through Temporal workflows with automatic retry logic. When transient failures occur (database timeouts, network issues), Temporal transparently retries until success or a configured limit. This means your API stays reliable even when downstream services are flaky.

**Endpoints you get:** Customer info, account details, statements, transactions, contact info, payment and asset transfer network data

### Client Application (`apps/app`)

The Relying Party—basically, the app that needs to access protected data. Built with `openid-client` (a certified library), it shows you how to do Authorization Code flow with PKCE properly. We built an interactive API explorer so you can poke around, plus tools for debugging tokens and viewing profile data. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies for security.

**The fun stuff:** API Explorer UI, token inspection, refresh token handling, automatic OIDC discovery that retries until it connects

### Shared Package (`apps/shared`)

Common utilities and TypeScript configs that all three apps use. Managed with pnpm workspaces.

## Getting Started

### What You Need (macOS)

```bash
brew install node pnpm caddy temporal
```

**Version requirements:**

- Node.js ≥22.0.0 (we enforce this in `package.json`)
- pnpm ≥10.15.1
- Caddy (latest is fine)
- Temporal CLI (latest is fine)

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs dependencies for all workspace packages. We're using pnpm workspaces with an `apps/*` pattern—it's a nice way to manage a monorepo.

## Commands You'll Use

### Development Mode

```bash
pnpm dev              # Run all services with hot reload (auth, api, worker, app)
pnpm dev:auth         # Just the Authorization Server
pnpm dev:api          # Just the Resource Server
pnpm dev:api:worker   # Just the Temporal Worker
pnpm dev:app          # Just the Client Application
```

**Note:** Before running `pnpm dev`, you need to start Temporal and Caddy in separate terminals.

### Production Mode

```bash
pnpm build            # Build everything (TypeScript + CSS)
pnpm --filter @apps/auth start   # Start Auth server
pnpm --filter @apps/api start    # Start API server
pnpm --filter @apps/app start    # Start Client app
```

### Other Helpful Commands

```bash
pnpm lint             # Check code style
pnpm lint:fix         # Fix what can be auto-fixed
pnpm caddy            # Start the reverse proxy (needs sudo)
pnpm temporal         # Start Temporal dev server
```

### Starting Temporal

The API uses Temporal for resilient data operations. Start the dev server before running the apps:

```bash
# In a dedicated terminal
pnpm temporal
```

This starts Temporal on `localhost:7233`. You can access the Temporal Web UI at `http://localhost:8233` to monitor workflows.

**Alternative: Docker**

```bash
docker run -d --name temporal -p 7233:7233 -p 8233:8233 temporalio/auto-setup:latest
```

### Setting Up HTTPS with Caddy

Caddy generates its own internal CA and handles TLS certificates automatically. Pretty neat.

#### Option A: Bind to port 443 (recommended)

```bash
# From the repo root
sudo caddy run --config ./caddyfile

# In another terminal, trust Caddy's CA
sudo caddy trust
```

This gives you nice URLs:

- `https://id.localtest.me` (Auth server)
- `https://app.localtest.me` (Client app)
- `https://api.localtest.me` (API server)

If your browser still complains about certificates, restart it or check your Keychain for the Caddy root CA.

#### Option B: No sudo? Use a high port

Edit the `caddyfile` and add a port to each site:

```caddyfile
:8443 {
  tls internal
  reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}
```

Then update your `.env` to use `https://localhost:8443` for the issuer and redirect URIs. Port 443 is easier, but this works if you can't use sudo.

### Running the Apps

Node.js doesn't use the macOS system trust store for TLS, so we need to point it to Caddy's CA manually.

```bash
# The easy way—this sets NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS for you
pnpm dev

# Running apps individually? Set this in your terminal first:
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt"
```

**A few notes:**

- You can actually start the Node apps before Caddy is ready. The client app will retry OIDC discovery until `https://id.localtest.me` responds. (You'll see some retry logs, but it'll eventually connect.)
- That said, starting Caddy first is faster and less noisy.
- If you switch terminals, remember to set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` again—or just use `pnpm dev` which handles it for you.

## Try It Out

Once everything's running, here's the fun part:

1. **Check the discovery endpoint**: Visit <https://id.localtest.me/.well-known/openid-configuration>. You should see JSON configuration data.

2. **Log in**: Head to <https://app.localtest.me> and click **Login**.

3. **Use the demo account**: Email is `user@example.test`, password is `passw0rd!`.

4. **Grant permissions**: You'll see a consent screen asking for:
   - `openid` - Basic identity
   - `profile` - Profile information
   - `email` - Email address
   - `offline_access` - Offline access (gives you refresh tokens)
   - `accounts:read` - Account data

5. **Explore the features**: Once you're logged in, check out:
   - **API Explorer** at `/api-explorer` - Interactive UI to test all the FDX endpoints
   - **Token Inspector** at `/token` - See your ID token claims and user info
   - **Token Debug** at `/debug/tokens` - Inspect the raw and decoded tokens (access, ID, refresh)

## What You Get

### Authorization Server (Auth)

- **Multiple client support** - Configure as many OAuth clients as you need via `.env.clients.json` (see `.env.clients.example.json`)
- **Refresh tokens** - Automatically issued when `offline_access` scope is requested. You can also force-enable them per client with `force_refresh_token: true`
- **Configurable token lifetimes**:
  - Session: 1 day
  - Access Token: 1 hour
  - ID Token: 1 hour
  - Refresh Token: 14 days
  - Grant: 1 year
- **Dynamic consent UI** - Shows all requested scopes with friendly descriptions

### Resource Server (API)

All the FDX v6.3 endpoints you need for Plaid Core Exchange:

- **Customer**: `/api/fdx/v6/customers/current`
- **Accounts**: `/api/fdx/v6/accounts`, `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}`
- **Statements**: `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/statements`, `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/statements/{statementId}`
- **Transactions**: `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`
- **Contact**: `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/contact`
- **Networks**: `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/payment-networks`, `/api/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/asset-transfer-networks`

Every endpoint validates JWT access tokens and enforces the right scopes.

**Temporal Integration:**

- All data operations run as Temporal workflows with automatic retries
- Retry policy: 10 attempts, exponential backoff (500ms to 5s), 30s timeout
- Non-retryable errors fail immediately without wasting retry attempts
- Monitor workflows in the Temporal Web UI at `http://localhost:8233`

**Chaos Testing:**

Enable chaos monkey to simulate failures and test resilience:

```bash
CHAOS_ENABLED=true CHAOS_ERROR_RATE=0.3 pnpm dev
```

This randomly injects errors (database timeouts, network failures, etc.) to demonstrate Temporal's retry capabilities. Watch the Temporal UI to see workflows automatically recovering from failures.

### Client Application (APP)

- **API Explorer** - Interactive UI for testing endpoints with query parameters
- **Token management** - Stores access tokens, refresh tokens, and ID tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Token debugging** - View raw and decoded JWT tokens at `/debug/tokens`
- **Token inspector** - Display ID token claims at `/token`
- **PKCE** - Uses Proof Key for Code Exchange (because security matters)

## Troubleshooting

**Getting 502 Bad Gateway or TLS errors like `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`?**

Make sure Caddy is running and trusted. Check that the Auth server is reachable at `https://id.localtest.me/.well-known/openid-configuration`. And double-check that `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` points to Caddy's CA:

```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt"
```

**Changed your ports or hostnames?**

Update `OP_ISSUER`, `APP_BASE_URL`, `API_BASE_URL`, and `REDIRECT_URI` in your `.env` file to match the routes Caddy is serving.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and tweak as needed. Here are the important bits:

### Basic Setup

```bash
# Service URLs
OP_ISSUER=https://id.localtest.me
APP_BASE_URL=https://app.localtest.me
API_BASE_URL=https://api.localtest.me

# Ports
OP_PORT=3001
APP_PORT=3004
API_PORT=3003

# Single Client (default setup)
# Use the scripts/secrets.js CLI app to generate new secrets
CLIENT_ID=dev-rp-CHANGE-FOR-PRODUCTION
CLIENT_SECRET=dev-secret-CHANGE-FOR-PRODUCTION
REDIRECT_URI=https://app.localtest.me/callback

# Security (please change these for production!)
# Use the scripts/secrets.js CLI app to generate new secrets
COOKIE_SECRET=dev-cookie-secret-CHANGE-FOR-PRODUCTION
API_AUDIENCE=api://my-api

# Temporal (optional - defaults shown)
TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=localhost:7233
TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=default

# Chaos Testing (for resilience demos)
CHAOS_ENABLED=false
CHAOS_ERROR_RATE=0.1
```

### Generating Secure Secrets

For production deployments, you should generate cryptographically secure secrets instead of using the default development values. We provide a CLI tool that makes this easy:

```bash
# Generate OAuth client credentials (CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET)
node scripts/secrets.js client

# Generate client credentials with a custom prefix
node scripts/secrets.js client --prefix myapp

# Generate application secrets (COOKIE_SECRET, etc.)
node scripts/secrets.js secrets

# Generate JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) for token signing
node scripts/secrets.js jwks

# Generate everything at once (client, secrets, and JWKS)
node scripts/secrets.js all

# Show help
node scripts/secrets.js --help
```

The tool generates:

- **CLIENT_ID**: URL-safe random string (32 characters, or 24 + prefix)
- **CLIENT_SECRET**: Cryptographically secure hex string (64 characters)
- **COOKIE_SECRET**: Secure hex string (64 characters)
- **JWKS**: RSA key pair (RS256, 2048 bits) formatted as a JSON Web Key Set

**Security best practices:**

- Never commit generated secrets to version control
- Use different secrets for each environment (dev, staging, production)
- Store production secrets in secure environment variables or secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Rotate secrets regularly in production

### Token Signing Keys (JWKS)

#### Development vs Production

**Development (default):**

- If you don't set the `JWKS` environment variable, `oidc-provider` will automatically generate ephemeral (temporary) signing keys on startup
- These keys use the default key ID (`kid`) of `"keystore-CHANGE-ME"`
- Keys are regenerated every time the auth server restarts, invalidating all existing tokens
- This is perfectly fine for local development since tokens have short lifetimes (1 hour)

**Production (required):**

- You **MUST** provide your own JWKS to prevent token invalidation on server restarts
- Generate persistent signing keys with `node scripts/secrets.js jwks`
- Store the JWKS in a secure environment variable or secret manager
- The generated JWKS contains **PRIVATE KEY material** - treat it like any other secret!

#### Why This Matters

When the Authorization Server signs JWT tokens (ID tokens and access tokens), it uses a private key and includes the key ID (`kid`) in the JWT header. The Resource Server (API) uses the public key from the JWKS endpoint to verify token signatures.

**Problems with ephemeral keys in production:**

1. **Service restarts invalidate all tokens** - Users and applications must re-authenticate
2. **Load balancing issues** - Different servers may have different keys
3. **No key rotation strategy** - Can't implement proper cryptographic key rotation
4. **Debugging difficulties** - The generic `kid` value doesn't help identify which key was used

**Benefits of persistent keys:**

1. **Tokens survive restarts** - Access/ID tokens remain valid across deployments
2. **Proper key rotation** - You can add new keys while keeping old ones for validation
3. **Better security** - Control your cryptographic material instead of relying on auto-generated keys
4. **Meaningful key IDs** - Generated keys have unique identifiers like `key-abc123def456`

#### Setting Up JWKS for Production

```bash
# Generate JWKS
node scripts/secrets.js jwks

# Add the output to your .env file or secret manager
JWKS='{"keys":[{"kty":"RSA","n":"...","e":"AQAB","d":"...","kid":"key-abc123","alg":"RS256","use":"sig"}]}'
```

The generated JWKS includes:

- **Public components** (`kty`, `n`, `e`, `kid`, `alg`, `use`) - Exposed at `/.well-known/jwks.json`
- **Private components** (`d`, `p`, `q`, `dp`, `dq`, `qi`) - Used for signing, never exposed

**Important notes:**

- The JWKS is a JSON string, so wrap it in single quotes in your `.env` file
- Never commit this to version control - it contains private key material
- For production, store in AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar
- You can have multiple keys in the `keys` array for key rotation

### Refresh Token Controls

Want refresh tokens even without the `offline_access` scope? Add a per-client flag in `.env.clients.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "dev-rp",
    "client_secret": "dev-secret",
    "redirect_uris": ["https://app.localtest.me/callback"],
    "post_logout_redirect_uris": ["https://app.localtest.me"],
    "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
    "response_types": ["code"],
    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
    "force_refresh_token": true
  }
]
```

### Multiple Client Setup

Need to support multiple OAuth/OIDC clients? Create a `.env.clients.json` file in the project root:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "app1",
    "client_secret": "secret1",
    "redirect_uris": ["https://app1.example.com/callback"],
    "post_logout_redirect_uris": ["https://app1.example.com"],
    "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
    "response_types": ["code"],
    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic"
  }
]
```

Check out `.env.clients.example.json` for a complete example.

**Client loading priority:**

1. `OIDC_CLIENTS` environment variable (JSON string)
2. `.env.clients.json` file
3. Falls back to single client from `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET`

If you change `OP_ISSUER` or ports, remember to update the client registration (especially redirect URIs) and restart everything.

## JWT Access Tokens with Resource Indicators (RFC 8707)

We use **Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 (RFC 8707)** to issue **JWT access tokens** instead of opaque tokens. This matters if your API needs to validate tokens locally without calling back to the auth server.

### Why Resource Indicators?

In `oidc-provider` v7+, the old `formats.AccessToken: "jwt"` config was deprecated. Now, if you want JWT access tokens, you need to use Resource Indicators (`resourceIndicators`). It's a bit more work, but it's the right way to do it.

### How It Works

The `accessTokenFormat` property in `getResourceServerInfo()` determines what kind of token you get:

```typescript
resourceIndicators: {
  enabled: true,
  getResourceServerInfo: async (ctx, resourceIndicator, client) => {
    return {
      scope: "openid profile email accounts:read",
      audience: "api://my-api",
      accessTokenFormat: "jwt",  // This is the magic line—JWT instead of opaque
      accessTokenTTL: 3600
    };
  }
}
```

### The Gotcha: Three Places to Add `resource`

Here's the tricky part—you need to include the `resource` parameter in **three different places**:

1. **Authorization Request** (`/login` route):

   ```typescript
   const url = client.buildAuthorizationUrl(config, {
     redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
     scope: "openid email profile offline_access accounts:read",
     resource: "api://my-api"  // Stores resource in the authorization code
   });
   ```

2. **Token Exchange Request** (`/callback` route):

   ```typescript
   const tokenSet = await client.authorizationCodeGrant(
     config,
     currentUrl,
     { pkceCodeVerifier, expectedState },
     { resource: "api://my-api" }  // Triggers JWT token issuance
   );
   ```

3. **Refresh Token Request** (`/refresh` route):

   ```typescript
   const tokenSet = await client.refreshTokenGrant(
     config,
     refreshToken,
     { resource: "api://my-api" }  // Ensures refreshed token is also JWT
   );
   ```

### Why You Need All Three

If you forget to include `resource` in the token exchange (step 2), `oidc-provider` does something unexpected:

- When `openid` scope is present and there's no `resource` parameter in the token request
- It issues an **opaque token** for the UserInfo endpoint instead
- This happens even if you configured `getResourceServerInfo` to return JWT format

It's a quirk in how `oidc-provider` resolves resources (see `lib/helpers/resolve_resource.js` if you're curious). The fix is simple—just include `resource` in all three places.

### How to Check If It's Working

Turn on debug logging to see what kind of tokens you're getting:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm dev
```

Look for the token response log. JWT tokens look like this:

```json
{
  "accessTokenLength": 719,        // JWT: ~700-900 characters
  "accessTokenParts": 3,           // JWT: 3 parts (header.payload.signature)
  "accessTokenPrefix": "eyJhbGci"  // JWT: Base64 "eyJ" prefix
}
```

If you see opaque tokens (wrong!), they'll be:

- Length: 43 characters
- Parts: 1 (single random string)
- No Base64 prefix

### Resource Indicator Format Rules

Resource indicators need to be absolute URIs. Here's what works and what doesn't:

```typescript
// ✅ Good
"api://my-api"
"https://api.example.com"
"https://api.example.com/v1"

// ❌ Bad
"my-api"                           // Not an absolute URI
"https://api.example.com#section"  // Can't have fragments (#)
```

### Quick Reference

**In the Auth Server** ([apps/auth/src/index.ts](apps/auth/src/index.ts)):

- `resourceIndicators.enabled`: Set to `true`
- `resourceIndicators.defaultResource()`: Fallback resource when client doesn't specify one
- `resourceIndicators.getResourceServerInfo()`: Returns `accessTokenFormat: "jwt"` (this is the important one)
- `resourceIndicators.useGrantedResource()`: Allows reusing resource from the auth request

**In the Client** ([apps/app/src/index.ts](apps/app/src/index.ts)):

- Authorization URL: Add `resource` parameter
- Token exchange: Add `resource` in the 4th parameter
- Refresh token: Add `resource` in the 3rd parameter

## Debugging OAuth Flows

Want to see what's happening under the hood? Add this to your `.env`:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

You'll get detailed logs about:

- **Authorization requests** - client_id, redirect_uri, scopes, response_type, state, resource
- **Login attempts** - email provided, success/failure
- **Consent flow** - grants created/reused, scopes granted, claims requested, resource indicators
- **Token issuance** - refresh token decisions, resource server info, token format (JWT vs opaque)
- **Account lookups** - subject lookups and claim retrieval

We use Pino for structured JSON logging. Here's what a log entry looks like:

```json
{
  "level": 20,
  "time": 1234567890,
  "name": "op",
  "uid": "abc123",
  "clientId": "dev-rp",
  "requestedScopes": ["openid", "email", "profile", "offline_access"],
  "msg": "GET /interaction/:uid - Interaction details loaded"
}
```

**Helpful log filters:**

```bash
# Watch for debug and error messages
pnpm dev | grep -i "debug\|error"

# Filter by specific OAuth events
pnpm dev | grep "interaction\|login\|consent\|issueRefreshToken\|getResourceServerInfo"
```

## What's Next

This is a demo implementation with in-memory storage. If you're taking this to production, you'll want to add:

- **Persistent storage** - Swap in a PostgreSQL adapter for `oidc-provider` so authorization codes, sessions, and grants survive restarts
- **Real user authentication** - Replace the in-memory user store with a proper database and password hashing (bcrypt or Argon2)
- **End-to-end tests** - Add Playwright or Cypress tests to verify the complete authentication flow
- **Production hardening** - Rate limiting, audit logging, and monitoring instrumentation
- **Dynamic client registration** - Let clients register themselves via an API endpoint instead of manual config files
